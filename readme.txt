== Description ==

Turn your wordpress blog into a games arcade!

This beta version WordPress plugin, WP Games Embed, makes it easy to embed games into your 
WordPress blog by using shortcodes in your posts and pages. WP Games Embed is intended to be able to 
support content offered by the various free games sites out there using the codes or downloads 
they provide.

FEATURES

4 Different views:

1. Grid view - a grid of thumbnail images linking to each game (can be restricted to a single category 
or parent category)

2. Category view - this view includes a medium sized image and a written description of the game

3. Single page view - the page where you play the game itself
   
4. Featured Game view - this view is similar to category view, but allows you to pick the games yourself 
to create your own 'Featured Games' page.

Different embedding modes:

1. iFrame embedding - embed iFrame content using code provided by free games sites, or use this method to display games from your own server where an html file has been provided with the free game download.
   
2. Flash embedding - embed Flash content using embed codes provided by other sites, or embed flash games directly from your own site. You can even upload them easily using the wordpress 'Add Media' tool.
